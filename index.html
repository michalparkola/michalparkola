	<h1>Michał Parkoła</h1>

	<h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
	<p>I'm the founder of <a href="http://fluidcircle.net">Fluid Circle</a> (an Agile training & consulting company) and <a href="http://peopleskillsforgeeks.com">People Skills for Geeks</a> (live events & online courses). Right now I'm helping <a href="http://elpassion.com">EL Passion</a> find app development clients and researching online education ideas.</p>
	<h2>Writer</h2>
	<p>I wrote "<a href="https://fluidcircle.net/zasoby/30-dni-scrum/">30 Days of Scrum</a>" a series of articles in Polish about the basics of Scrum. I wrote several <a href="http://fluidcircle.net/case">case studies</a> about how companies use Agile. I co-translated and published Jurgen Appelo's "<a href="http://fluidcircle.net/zmiana">How to Change the World</a>".</p>
	<h2>Speaker</h2>
	<p>I spoke at multiple meetup and conferences including "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KMuv5SQYiI">Thinking Tools for Product Owners</a>" at Agile by Example 2014 and "<a href="https://vimeo.com/130576079">How do great Entrepreneurs Think</a>" at Geecon 2015.</p>
	<h2>Agile Coach</h2>
	<p>I've spent the last year helping a large multinational travel software corporation become more Agile. Here's how the lead coach there <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q66lrF22_cc">described working with me</a>. Previously I've trained, advised or coached a multitude of different teams and companies. I'm a SAFe Program Consultant (SPC).</p>
	<h2>Go Player</h2>
	<p>At the height of my career I (briefly) held the rank of 3 dan (European). I was the organizer of many local, national and international tournaments including the 2004 European Go Championship. I've held various roles in the Polish Go Association for more than a decade now.</p>
