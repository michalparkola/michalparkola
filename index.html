						Agile Coach
					</h2>
					<p>
						I've spent the last year helping a large multinational travel software corporation become more Agile. Here's how the lead coach there <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q66lrF22_cc">described working with me</a>. Previously I've trained, advised or coached a multitude of different teams and companies. I'm a SAFe Program Consultant (SPC).

						At the height of my career I (briefly) held the rank of 3 dan (European). I was the organizer of many local, national and international tournaments including the 2004 European Go Championship. I've held various roles in the Polish Go Association for more than a decade now.
