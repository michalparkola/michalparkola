				<h4>The Three Levels of Asynchronous Collaboration</h4>
				<p></p>
				<h5>Level 1: Flexible yet Productive</h5>
				<p>At this level we're building the foundation that enables flexibility and helps improve work-life balance while maintaining or improving productivity. More importantly we're enabling higher-level practices to be built on top of the foundation.</p>

				<p>At this level we're likely to need to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/anywhereworkshop/">build a foundation for remote teamwork</a></li>
					<li>communicate clearly in writing
						<ul><li>clear & unambiguous</li><li>concise</li><li>meaningful</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>clarify outcomes and actions - Who? What? When? Where? Why? (How?)</li>
					<li>follow through on agreements, keep each other accountable</li>
					<li>keep progress transparent</li>
					<li>in case of problems ask or renegotiate early</li>
					<li>get feedback and adjust</li>
				</ul>
			
				<h5>Level 2: NoStandups</h5>
				<p>At this level the flow of work is transparent enough such that everyone can see what's going on and make good decisions without the need for lengthy status and planning meetings. Real-time discussions are used for higher level sense-making, problem-solving and relationship-building.</p>

				<p>At this level we're likely to need to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>align to needs at the start, in the middle and at the end</li>
					<li>even better writing skills and habits</li>
					<li>build a well-organized information system to capture things without getting flooded</li>
					<li>strong alignment using clear, concise and meaningfull content & transparency of outcomes (metrics, dashboards, stories)</li>
					<li>make the invisible, visible - "show me" is our mantra</li>
					<li>have a living handbook of standard practices - separate law and advice</li>	
				</ul>

				<h5>Level 3: AsyncABC (Brick & Mortar)</h5>
				<p>This is where the magic happens. Build a strong habit of packaging the work you're already doing in a way that can be referenced, reused and built upon. Enable knowledge to accumulate over time. Generate an explosion of value emerging from unexpected connections.</p>
				<p>Do it by repeating the following three steps in a continuous loop:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>(A)lign to Needs</li>
					<li>Build (B)ricks</li>
					<li>(C)onnect Everything</li>
				</ol>
